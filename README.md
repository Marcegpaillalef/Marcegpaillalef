### 👋 Hi, I’m Marcela Yasmin Gonzalez Paillalef
👀  I am an astrophysicist transitioning into data analytics, passionate about uncovering hidden patterns in data and turning them into actionable insights for decision-making. 
Throughout my career in astrophysics, I developed strong analytical skills and a unique ability to work with large volumes of complex data—skills I now apply to data analysis.

### 🎯 **From Astrophysics to Data Analyst**
After several years of working in scientific research, I decided to follow my passion for data and its potential to solve real-world problems. This transition has been exciting, as I've found many parallels between scientific methods and data analysis.
I now apply those same principles to tackle business, financial, and other sector challenges.

### 💞️ ** My Next Challenge**
